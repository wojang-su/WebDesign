                <h1>What is Medication for ADHD?</h1>
                <p>
                    Stimulants are the most common type of medication prescribed for the attention deficit hyperactive disorder.<br>
                    <br>Stimulants such as <span>Ritalin and Adderall are the most common prescribed medication for the patients.</span> Stimulants reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity and help the patients to focus.<br>
                    <br>However, the medication has a rebound effect which only works for the short-term.
                    The medication for ADHD overdose is a serious problem which could cause death to patient. Moreover, its long-term side effects could damage the patients’ brains and bodies.<br>
                    <br>Adderall includes amphetamine and Ritalin as methylphenidate.

                <p>Medications for the ADHD could cause several side effects such as sleep problem, decreased appetite, delayed growth, headaches, stomachaches, Tics, and moodiness.<br>
                <br>Side effects are the most worried problem before selecting a treatment for the ADHD patients.

                <h1>Report Result</h1>
                <p>
                    I researched two report results about medication for the ADHD. Dr. Christel Renoux conducted the study which used the UK CPRD database.<br>
                    <br>It is one of the world’s largest electronic databases of anonymized primary care medical that records on a population over 13 million patients enrolled with more than 680 general practices. The study defined all patients between 6 to 45 years of old.<br>
                    <br>This report proves that the prescription rates for the ADHD medication increased dramatically from 2000 to 2015.
                    <br>Also, <span>most of the prescriptions contain Methylphenidate which remained the most prescribed
                    drug over the years, particularly in children and young adults.</span> Renoux C.,(2016).<br>
                    <img src="images/data2.png" alt="data2" width="700" height="700">
                    <br>
                    Another report conducted by Zheng Chang. “This diagnosis is based on 38,752 ADHD born between 1960 and 1998 in Sweden.".<br>
                    <img src="images/data3.png" alt="data3" width="800" height="300">
                    <br>Concomitant occurrence of depression was 36% less common during periods when patients received the ADHD medication compared with periods when they did not receive the medication.<br>
                    <br>Moreover, the ADHD medication reduced the rate of depression by 20% even within individuals.<br>
                    <br>Also, medication was associated with a reduced risk for subsequent and concurrent depression.
                    <br>Chang Z.,(2016).<br>
                    <br>In conclusion, the medications for ADHD, especially Methylphenidate, is well known of its association with the high rates of psychiatric comorbidity that includes depression. <span>However, it actually prevents people from getting psychiatric comorbidity. </span>Although it could cause some side effects, they are common symptoms which could happen to people without ADHD. The medication treatment for ADHD is a treatment which does not give a serious damage to patients.<br>
                    However, if you are worried to take the medicine, then avoid to take the medicine with Methylphenidate.
